    "- Transition from clear pattern with two jet cores, two cold vortexes and large hot-spot shift at 5 day period, to pattern with single (?) strong jet, no single vortex, and continuous hot band (in mid-atmosphere) at 1 day period\n",
    "- This is similar to results of Carone paper\n",
    "- 30 day period has similar circulation to 5 day, but less redistribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "NB the runs are starting already spun-up, so may not show the waves forming - I can do some from rest?\n",

    "Compare results to Carone - transition to single jet at low (< 3 day) period.\n",

    "5 day has \"more\" extra-tropical, so two jets and vortexes shifted west compared to 30 day?\n",
